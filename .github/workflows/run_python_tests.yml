# This workflow will install Python dependencies, run tests and lint with a variety of Python versions
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-python-with-github-actions
# 
# Notes:
# - torch==1.7 added native support for complex numbers
# - torch==1.8? removed non native complex numbers support
# - torch==1.9 renamed 'torch.solve(B, A)[0]' to 'torch.linalg.solve(A, B)'
# - Some tests are only executed if the torch version is 1.7, because that is the only version that supports native and non native complex numbers
# 
# Py37 was remove in Jan 08, 2025 from Ubuntu 22.04 (https://github.com/actions/runner-images/pull/11299)
# Py38 will be removed on Jun 06, 2025 (https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/12034)

# Github Action cannot be used to test torch==1.6 anymore. torch==1.6 is not available to py39+ and Github Action has removed py38
